# work-tools

## Why?
I want to help and to learn. Hopefully the solutions here will be useful.

## What?
How and what I solve are influenced by what we use. If you see overlap with
your district, I'm more likely to have experience dealing with it and can help,
so please ask!

### Stuff we use!
* High School Only District
* GSuite for Education Enterprise
* Aeries SIS
* Canvas LMS
* 1-2-1 Chromebooks
* AWS (Most)
* GCP (Some)
* Azure (Least. AAD and Office 365)

### Stuff I use!
My daily driver is a Chromebook that I use to connect to a cloud terminal for
my work. Sometimes [Cloud9 in AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/), but more
often lately [GCP's cloud shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell) or a VM in
GCP.

My lifeblood flows from the Linux command line, vim, bash, screen, ssh, python,
golang, node, etc. As a result this is how I solve most of my problems. Though
I can solve all the same problems using Windows tools, they are not as refined.
That said if need help with something I've solved and would like help figuring
it out on Windows, let me know!

I also live in the cloud and rely heavily on terraform to manage infrastructure
in AWS, GCP, and Azure.
